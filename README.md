# Dance Mat Typing Bot

a project that i made because i was bored

# Running & Compiling

## Compiling

This is made in python so you can't really compile it, but you can "compile" it by using py2exe

## Running

Use `py main.py` or `python3 main.py` to run it

# Notes

- Leave the game at the main menu screen, because the script presses enter for you

- When the game clicks at the next stage button at the end of the game, it could click the wrong thing because of the coords I used, so this might only work on Windows 11 on a 1920x1080 display

- Sadly, this only works on Level 1 Stage 1 (this is because i am lazy and i dont wanna go through the effort of doing that)
